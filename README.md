We do not yet have monitoring in place for our bots. If you ever see that they are down/non-responsive, please run the following command:

`ssh -t bots.bocoup.com sudo service bots restart`

_**Note:** you will be prompted for your [shell account](https://github.com/bocoup/infrastructure/wiki/Shell-Account) shadow password._

Also, please open an issue noting that this happened!
